## Overview

Our multi-agent system is designed to perform complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, specialized subtasks. Each agent is responsible for a specific part of the process, and they work together to achieve the overall goal. This approach allows for modularity, flexibility, and the ability to leverage different AI models for different tasks.

## Agent Types

### 1. Web Scraper Agent
- **File**: `webScraperAgent.js`
- **Purpose**: Fetches and cleans content from websites
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses axios for HTTP requests
  - Employs cheerio for HTML parsing
  - Includes retry logic for robust scraping
  - Cleans and formats scraped content

### 2. Summarizer Agent
- **File**: `summarizerAgent.js`
- **Purpose**: Creates concise summaries of longer texts
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses local Ollama AI model
  - Handles various text lengths and types
  - Provides error handling for unclear or problematic input

### 3. Sentiment Analyzer Agent
- **File**: `sentimentAnalyzerAgent.js`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the sentiment of text
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses OpenAI's model for advanced sentiment analysis
  - Categorizes sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral
  - Provides detailed explanations for sentiment classifications

### 4. Data Visualizer Agent
- **File**: `dataVisualizerAgent.js`
- **Purpose**: Describes how to visualize data based on analysis results
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses local Ollama AI model
  - Creates textual descriptions of charts and graphs
  - Adapts to various types of input data

## Agent Interactions

Our agents work together in a sequential chain:

1. The Web Scraper Agent fetches and cleans web content.
2. The Summarizer Agent creates a concise summary of the scraped content.
3. The Sentiment Analyzer Agent analyzes the sentiment of the summary.
4. The Data Visualizer Agent describes how to visualize the sentiment analysis results.

This chain allows for complex data processing and analysis tasks to be broken down into manageable steps, each handled by a specialized agent.

## Using the Agents

To use the multi-agent system, you typically don't need to interact with individual agents directly. Instead, use the `runMultiAgentChain` function in `MultiAgentChainDemo.js`. This function orchestrates the entire process.

Example usage:

```javascript
const { runMultiAgentChain } = require('./demos/MultiAgentChainDemo');

runMultiAgentChain()
  .then(() => console.log('Multi-agent process completed successfully'))
  .catch(error => console.error('An error occurred:', error));
```

## Extending the Agent System

To add a new agent to the system:

1. Create a new file for your agent (e.g., `newAgent.js`) in the `agents` directory.
2. Implement the agent's functionality, following the pattern of existing agents.
3. Add the new agent to the chain in `MultiAgentChainDemo.js`.

Example of a new agent:

```javascript
async function newAgent(input) {
  const prompt = `Perform a specific task with this input: "${input}"`;
  const response = await askAI(API_URL, MODEL_NAME, prompt);
  return response;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Web scraping fails**: Check your internet connection and the target website's availability. You may need to adjust the scraping logic for specific websites.

2. **AI model errors**: Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file and that you have necessary permissions for the AI services you're using.

3. **Unexpected agent output**: Review the input being passed between agents. You may need to add additional error checking or preprocessing steps.

4. **Performance issues**: If the chain is running slowly, consider running agents in parallel where possible or optimizing individual agent operations.

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the console output for error messages and refer to the logs generated by each agent.
