## 🌟 Overview

MinimalChaining provides a simple yet powerful way to interact with AI models in a sequential, context-aware manner. It's particularly useful for applications that require multi-step AI interactions, such as story generation, complex problem-solving, or any task that benefits from maintaining context across multiple AI queries. The framework now includes integration with OpenAI's GPT models and supports structured output.

## ✨ Features

- Sequential, context-aware AI interactions
- Flexible integration with various AI models, including OpenAI's GPT models
- Structured output support for more reliable and consistent AI responses
- Modular design for easy customization and extension
- Built-in utilities for common tasks (file operations, error handling, etc.)
- Demo applications showcasing practical usage

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimalchaining.git
   cd minimalchaining
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file in the root directory with your AI model configurations:
   ```
   API_URL=http://localhost:11434/api/generate
   MODEL_NAME=llama3.1:latest
   PORT=3000
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the MinimalChainable class with OpenAI integration:

```javascript
const MinimalChainable = require('./MinimalChainable');
const { askOpenAI } = require('./utils/openAiUtils');
const { z } = require('zod');

async function runChain() {
  const context = { topic: "AI" };
  const prompts = [
    "Introduce the concept of {{topic}}",
    "Explain a key application of {{topic}}",
    "Discuss the future of {{topic}}"
  ];

  const StorySchema = z.object({
    content: z.string().describe("The content of the story part"),
    mood: z.enum(["happy", "sad", "excited", "mysterious"]).describe("The mood of this part of the story")
  });

  const [responses, _] = await MinimalChainable.run(
    context,
    process.env.OPENAI_MODEL,
    (prompt) => askOpenAI(prompt, StorySchema),
    prompts
  );

  responses.forEach((response, index) => {
    console.log(`Response ${index + 1} (${response.mood}):`, response.content);
  });
}

runChain();
```

## 🧠 Core Components

### MinimalChainable

The heart of the framework, `MinimalChainable` manages the sequence of prompts and responses, maintaining context throughout the chain of interactions.

Key methods:
- `run(context, model, callable, prompts)`: Executes the chain of prompts.
- `toDelimTextFile(name, content, directory)`: Saves the results to a file.

### OpenAI Integration

The `openAiUtils.js` file provides integration with OpenAI's GPT models, supporting structured output for more reliable and consistent responses.

## 🛠 Tools Framework

Our tools framework provides a set of utilities that extend the AI's capabilities:

- File System Operations
- Logging
- Error Handling
- Environment Variable Management
- String Manipulation

## 🎭 Demos

1. **StoryBuddy**: Generates stories using AI with structured output.
   ```
   node demos/storyBuddy/StoryBuddy.js
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

We use Jest for testing. Run all tests with:

```
npm test
```

## 🎨 Customization

MinimalChaining is designed to be easily customizable:

- Modify `MinimalChainable.js` to change the core chaining logic.
- Add or modify utility modules in the `utils/` directory for additional functionality.
- Create new demo applications in the `demos/` directory to showcase different use cases.
